download map per package, still a bug, the Onlinemap doesn't properly visualise the textures without wifi

bug in local packages, the color of the text doesn't change on the observables

progress for download package info

when showing model turn off other input

local packages-> 
    mutliselect for map download, 
    single click for draw or delete, 
    color if map loaded

online packages->
    color if package already downloaded

draw elements panel->
    click instead of multiselect

bigger buttons

long press for item selection

in extra settings
be able to jump to where package is drawn (bottom right menu)

test android/win/osx

some zip packages give faults

---------------------

refactor the gui of packages, make a single panel with color codes for downloaded packages, downloaded map, 
bad zip, bad map request-> its interaction: when clicking a package it is selected (first for download) 
when its downloaded a long press will open a panel with "more info" "draw" "delete", multiselect is also possible with short press
with same interactions for multiple packages except draw.  

deeper zoom allowed / smooth zoom for map and it's elements
OnlineMaps.zoom
OnlineMapsControlBase.ZoomOnPoint
OnlineMapsMarkerBase.constructor

rewrite drawpackages in GUIFactory with observables

make drawelement inactive if not in view

refactor GUIFactory more hierarchically

drawelements->monobehaviour

increase resolution 
You can increase the text size stylize map using snazzymaps or mapbox.
Read sections «Styled Google Maps» and «Using Mapbox» in the documentation.

add if in editor tags for debug logs and send other logs with mail if not in editor
